Dataset Portlet
------------------------
This is the core portlet of the open data platform. It
 - displays search result and dataset details pages
 - allows for facetting, i.e. filtered searches
 - handles dataset specific user interaction, i.e. commenting and rating
 - relies heavily on the opendataregistry-client.
